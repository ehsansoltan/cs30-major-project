# Major Project Proposal
For my major project, I will attempt to create an ascii roguelike. My game will involve traversing through dungeons, collecting items, and defeating enemies.

## Need to Have List
-character movement
-a game environment (not necessarily procedurally generated)
-enemies
-items
-some sort of procedural generation (for example, item and enemy placement)
-textual descriptions of what's happening (e.g "the wildebeest strikes you.")


## Nice to Have List
-a procedurally generated game world
-character creation
-a (relatively) realistic field of vision algorithm
-saving progress
-a nice UI
