Overall:
I am relatively happy with my project. As a game, it is not very fun, however this was a learning experience in which I learned
many of the staples of writing roguelikes. I managed to learn how to write and incorporate all of the basics of a proper roguelike (which spans all of my 'need to haves' and some of my 'nice to haves'), such as a procedurally generated map, monsters, weapons, attacking, and textual descriptions of game events. I think I am most proud of my procedural generation map algorithm, as I was totally clueless as to how to write one; I had only researched some general concepts of procedural map generation and didn't look at anyone else's code on the internet in order to make this more of a learning experience.

Problems:
The first and biggest programming problem I ran into was my procedurally generated map not looking the way i wanted it to.
my initial algorithm was poorly designed, it generated maps that weren't aesthetically pleasing and it was cluttered (too many corridors, corridors that were adjacent and parallel to each other at the same time etc). I resolved
this problem by restarting and planning things out better the second time, resulting in the algorithm i have now, which generates
maps which don't look as ugly.

Another problem I ran into was when I was trying to write an 'attack' function. It did not work initially because apparently "attack" is a function that is built into p5js. The problem was resolved (after more time than I care to admit) by renaming my function.
